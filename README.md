# EcosystemProject
2D Ecosystem simulation project made by Van Olffen Victor & Mettioui Mourad

## Simulation
The simulation contains multiples entities. It has animals and plants.
The animals have a gender ("Male" or "Female") and they are either carnivorous or herbivorous. When an animal dies, he becomes meat.
After some time, the animals poop. If the meat is not eaten, it becomes poop. They can fight each other to get food.
Plants feed from the poop and they can create new plants.

- Pink Circle             : Female Carnivours Animal
- Blue Circle             : Male Herbivorous Animal
- Light Blue Circle       : Female Herbivorous Animal
- Green Circle            : Plant
